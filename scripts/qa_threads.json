This seems like just like you are saying \"malwares = bad\" to me.\n\nThe DHT works by finding the closest node to the hash you wanna store, to do so peer id hashes and files are XORed together, this will allow to rank each node compared to how close it is to a file.\nNodes also searches for similar nodes to themself, so this creates a web of node connected by how matching are their peer id.\nYou then ask the closest node you know if it know this hash, if it doesn't and know it and know a better node it will redirect you to it.\nSo lets assume that my node host a file, to be found later when needed it is gonna store this info in the DHT, to do so it will search for the closets node, repeat with more closets, and if this node happen to be a storm node well no mater how good you will be searching for this node you will never contact it, and so all the nodes you will be able to contact will all be too far away from mine and not know that I host this file, so you will never be able to find it.\n\nSecondly this XOR distance space (actually it's an adic distance in gallois fields so it's not the same notion of distance we both have in mind). When comparing it with all other nodes, you would see maybe a V shape, where at the edge of the V rellies the node far away from your hash and at the tip the most closets node, the one storing metadata (such as who provide what) about the hash.\nIf you exclude some part of the network randomly you can think that this nice V with 1 solution we all agree no matter our starting point (just follow the slope down) will change into a W, here there would be 2 point where the node wouldn't know any better solution, and so me starting on the right could find a certain node as the best one, and you on the left an other one. (actually one of both nodes would need to know better solutions, because else they would create a bucket together and they would be able to point you from one tip of the W to an other, it's just that all better solutions proposed would be storm nodes).\na DHT search is only capable to find a local best solution (just go down the slope), so if there are multiple local solutions it's really damn hard to back track your way a bit (the dht will try a bit, but quickly give up as this is an exponentially hard task), the way DHT work is in the way nodes will search for neighbors, this is made in a way that it only exists one best solution, not multiple, then the go down the slide work.\nBut cutting some nodes that the other nodes will not break this as then not everyone will agree on what is a best solution."}, {"author": "olehmell", "content": "Greate!
